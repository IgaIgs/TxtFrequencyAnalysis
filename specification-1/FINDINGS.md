## Word frequency analysis
Perhaps unsurprisingly for an English text, the words 'the' and 'and' have found themselves in the top 3 of the most frequent 
words in analysed text file. Just between them, on 2nd place, was the word 'of'. These 3 went over the threshold of 6000
occurrences, having been found in the text 14524, 6708 and 6410 times for 'the', 'of', 'and' respectively.
The next 3 words were 'a', 'to', and 'in' with 4668, 4652 and 4187 appearances, respectively.
The 2000 occurrences range includes 'that' with 2918, 'his' with 2516 and 'it' with 2323 incidences.
To finish this sum up with the 10 most frequent words, the last one here is the 'i' word, with 1845 occurrences, which 
includes all usages of 'I' as well, since all of the characters in this file have been change to lowercase for the purpose
of this analysis.

## Character frequency analysis
In terms of most frequent characters in the text, letters 'e', 't' and 'a' took the first three places, however

respectively. Letter 'o' was the only other that scored more than 70000 occurrences (70790). Following were the letters
'n', 'i', 's' and 'h', all with over 60000 incidences. To finish with the 10 most frequent characters, letters 'r' and'l'
appeared in the text 53585 and 43368 times, respectively.
